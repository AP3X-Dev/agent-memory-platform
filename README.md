# AMP — Agent Memory Protocol

**Every AI coding session starts from zero.** Your agent doesn't remember the architecture decisions from last week. It doesn't know that you tried approach X and it failed. It doesn't know your team prefers Zod over Joi, or that the auth module was rewritten last month. Every session, you re-explain. Every session, it makes the same mistakes you already corrected.

**AMP fixes that.**

With AMP, your AI agent accumulates knowledge across every session. Decisions get stored. Corrections stick. Conventions compound. The agent working on your codebase on day 30 has everything it learned on days 1–29 — the architecture, the tradeoffs, the "we tried that and here's why it didn't work."

It's not RAG. RAG retrieves documents and forgets. AMP **learns** — episodic memories get consolidated into high-confidence principles through signal-driven evolution, the same way a senior engineer builds intuition over time.

## What Changes For You

**Before AMP:**
- "We already fixed this bug last week" — agent doesn't know
- "Use the factory pattern here, not direct instantiation" — explained for the third time
- "The rate limit is 50/s, not 100" — agent uses stale knowledge from training data
- Context window fills up re-explaining your project to a blank-slate agent

**After AMP:**
- Agent loads project context in one call — architecture, conventions, past decisions, known gotchas
- Corrections from session 3 automatically inform session 30
- When knowledge changes (rate limit dropped from 100 to 50), old facts get invalidated and new facts supersede them — with full audit trail
- Multiple agents working on the same project share the same evolving knowledge base

---

## How It Works

AMP is a Neo4j knowledge graph exposed as 38 MCP tools. Your agent calls them autonomously — no workflow changes needed.

```
Session 1: Agent stores "auth module uses JWT, team prefers stateless for horizontal scaling"
                    ↓
Session 5: Agent stores "migrated auth to OAuth2 + PKCE" → old JWT fact auto-invalidated
                    ↓
Session 8: Three agents independently confirm the Zod validation pattern works
                    ↓
           Consolidation promotes "use Zod for validation" to high-confidence principle
                    ↓
Session 15: New agent loads context → knows about OAuth2, Zod convention, and WHY
```

### The Memory Stack

| Layer | What it captures | How it helps |
|-------|-----------------|--------------|
| **Episodic** | What happened each session — decisions, bugs, fixes | Full history, nothing lost |
| **Semantic** | Consolidated principles with confidence scores | "We know X because of Y" with 0.85 confidence |
| **Temporal Facts** | Structured knowledge with time bounds | "Rate limit WAS 100, changed to 50 on March 15" |
| **Architecture** | Entity relationships, aspects, dependency graph | "If you change X, these 12 things break" |
| **Code Intelligence** | AST-parsed symbols, multi-vector search | "Find all callers of this function across the codebase" |

### Progressive Disclosure

Your agent sees 7 tools by default. The other 39 activate on demand — no tool sprawl, no decision fatigue.

```
Always visible:  amp_load · amp_store · amp_memory_read · amp_memory_insert · amp_context · amp_grep · amp_tools
On demand:       9 domains (memory, temporal, admin, research, code, arch, wiki, retrieval, graph)
```

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- Docker (for Redis + Neo4j)

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AP3X-Dev/agent-memory-protocol.git
cd agent-memory-protocol

# Start the knowledge graph
docker compose up -d

# Configure
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your Neo4j password

# Install and run
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Connect to Your Agent

**Claude Code (SSE):**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "amp": {
      "type": "sse",
      "url": "http://localhost:3101/sse"
    }
  }
}
```

**Claude Code (stdio):**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "amp": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["tsx", "packages/mcp/src/server.ts", "--stdio"],
      "cwd": "/path/to/agent-memory-protocol",
      "env": {
        "NEO4J_URI": "bolt://localhost:7687",
        "NEO4J_USER": "neo4j",
        "NEO4J_PASSWORD": "your-password",
        "REDIS_URL": "redis://:your-password@localhost:6379"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Works with any MCP-compatible agent:** Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Cline, Codex, or custom agents.

### Hooks — a deterministic context floor (optional)

MCP + skills are **model-driven**: the agent decides whether to call `amp_load`. Hooks make context-loading **harness-driven** instead — AMP memory is injected at the start of every session (and every turn, on Claude Code) regardless of whether the model remembers to ask. Hooks complement skills; they don't replace them. The split is deliberate:

- **Load → hooks** (deterministic context-IN). Mechanical; the retrieval ranker decides relevance.
- **Store → MCP/skills** (model-judged knowledge-OUT). Only mechanical stores (session summary, pre-compact snapshot) fire from hooks.

Enable per agent:

```bash
# Claude Code — live hooks (SessionStart + per-turn UserPromptSubmit injection)
npx tsx packages/core/src/cli.ts hooks install --agent claude --scope project

# Codex / Hermes — materialize a managed block into AGENTS.md / .hermes.md,
# refreshed at launch via the wrapper:
npx tsx packages/core/src/cli.ts hooks install --agent codex
amp run --agent codex -- codex            # re-materializes, then launches codex

npx tsx packages/core/src/cli.ts hooks status      # what's wired where
npx tsx packages/core/src/cli.ts hooks uninstall --agent claude
```

Only **Claude Code** gets live per-turn injection; **Codex** and **Hermes** read a static file at startup, so they get a refreshed start-of-session block (the wrapper keeps it from going stale). Every load hook is **fail-open** with an 800ms timeout — a slow or down AMP never blocks a turn.

Prefer a UI? The wiki has a **Settings** page (`/settings`, port 3200) to enable/disable hooks per agent and tune timeouts/token budgets — tuning is written to `~/.config/amp/settings.json` and read live by hook processes (no restart). The same page shows the rest of AMP's effective config (cache TTLs, consolidation, decay half-lives, project-tag enforcement, embedding mode).

### Bootstrap Your Project

Copy `CLAUDE.md.example` (or `GEMINI.md.example`, `.cursorrules`) to your project and run `/amp-setup`. The agent analyzes your codebase, discovers entities, and scaffolds the knowledge graph. From that point on, every session loads and stores automatically.

## The 46 Tools

### Core Memory (7 always visible + 8 on demand)
| Tool | What it does for you |

| `amp_memory_read/insert` | Structured memory blocks: persona, user preferences, project state |
| `amp_grep` | Search across all memory by pattern |
| `amp_memory_promote/archive` | Graduate working notes to permanent knowledge, or archive completed work |

### Temporal Intelligence (2 tools)
| Tool | What it does for you |
|------|---------------------|
| `amp_timeline` | See how knowledge about any entity evolved over time |
| `amp_fact_diff` | "What changed about auth-module between January and March?" |

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `NEO4J_URI` | `bolt://localhost:7687` | Neo4j connection |
| `NEO4J_USER` | `neo4j` | Neo4j username |

| `MCP_PORT` | `3101` | MCP server port |
| `AMP_API_TOKEN` | — | Optional Bearer token for SSE endpoint auth |

## MCP Health Checks

When running the SSE server, AMP exposes two non-streaming HTTP checks:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3101/healthz
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $AMP_API_TOKEN" http://localhost:3101/readyz
```

- `GET /healthz` is unauthenticated liveness. It returns process status only and never includes token material.
- `GET /readyz` is authenticated readiness. It verifies the same Bearer token gate as `/sse` without opening an SSE stream.

## Development

```bash
npm run build          # Build all packages
npm test               # Run tests (600+)
npm run dev            # MCP server with hot reload
```
